snake - eat all the berries!

Use the arrow keys to direct the snake's move. Once directed, the snake will
keep crawling in the same direction, until directed in a new direction. The
snake won't move in an opposite direction; to head back, turn it, and then turn
it again.

If (when) the snake dies, press Enter to decompose the poor thing and spawn a
new living snake to keep at the forefathers' aspiration.

Esc quits the game.


 BUILDING

You will need

 * a C++14 compiler
 * Boost
 * SDL
 * a TTF font

Sorry about the TTF font point... I haven't taken the time to find a font I'm
positive is okay to distribute with the game.

Okay, let's build this thing:

 0  Make sure you have the prerequisites above covered.

 1  If you fetched the source from a repository then you'll need to run
    autoreconf first:

     $ autoreconf -if

 2  I made an effort to distribute this package as a good autoconf netizen. If
    the usual configure && make don't do the trick, you might try placing a
    config.site of your liking somewhere. Here's an example content of the
    file:

     $ cat ~/.config.site.clang
     CXX=clang++-3.6
     CPPFLAGS="-DNDEBUG"
     CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -O2"

    With that, build the source with configure and make:

     $ CONFIG_SITE=$HOME/.config.site.clang ./configure &&
     ` make -skj2 V=0

    This should build the program without errors and without warnings.

 3  Find a true-type font of your liking, create a directory data/ where you
    plan to run the executable, and copy the font in there. Rename the file to
    Arial.ttf.
