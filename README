snake - eat all the berries!

Use the arrow keys to direct the snake's move. Once directed, the snake will
keep crawling in the same direction, until directed in a new direction. The
snake won't move in an opposite direction; to head back, turn it, and then turn
it again.

If (when) the snake dies, press Enter to decompose the poor thing and spawn a
new living snake to keep at the forefathers' aspiration.

Esc quits the game.
